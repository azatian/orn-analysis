# orn-analysis
Adult (3-10 day) Drosophila ORN snRNAseq neuropeptide and neuropeptide receptor expression analysis
  - All sequence data was generated by Li Lab
  - Y-axis: barcoded cells grouped by which glomeruli it innervates in AL
  - X-axis: Drosophila neuropeptide/neuropeptide receptor gene expression of grouped cells
  - Interestingly, V (carbon dioxide circuit) cells are positive for sNPF expression and also for receptors AstA-R1, AstC-R2, Dh44-R1, MsR1, NPFR, Pdfr, SPR
  - ORN-ORN feedback modulation? 
  - The presence and abundance of these specific receptors in transcripts from nuclei of ORNs that innervate CO2 glomerulus may have a role in the olfactory processing of CO2 and ultimately behavior
